# Visualizing retaliatory evictions in Philadelphia

The goal of this project was to visualize the different aspects that describe the phenomenon of retaliatory evictions in the City of Philadelphia.

Retaliatory evictions consists in the process where landlords, after failing to comply with some aspect of their rental agreement or the sanitary or basic building conditions in their rental properties, have a violation filed against them by their renters and in return theaten to evict or file to evict these. Historically, this has become common practice for some property owners in the City of Philadelphia as they usually are legally represented in court and their renters [are not](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-renters-dealing-with-major-issues-forced-to-lie-down-and-take-it-or-risk-eviction/).

To better understand this issue it is necessary to understand its distribution both in time and throughout Philadelphia.

As well as comparing this to the spatial distribution of Building violations filed across the city:
